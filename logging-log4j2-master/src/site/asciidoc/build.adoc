= Building and Installing Log4j

NOTE: The information below is for developers who want to modify Log4j or contribute
to Log4j. If your goal is to add logging to your application you don't need to
build from the source code, you can link:download.html[download] the pre-built
binaries instead.

Log4j 2 is hosted in the Apache Software Foundation's Git repository. Details on obtaining the
most current source code can be found at
link:source-repository.html[Log4j Source Repository]. The source from the latest release may be
obtained by downloading it using the instructions at link:download.html[Log4j Downloads].

Log4j 2.x uses Maven 3 as its build tool. Log4j 2.x uses the Java 9 compiler in addition to 
the Java version installed in the path. This is accomplished by using Maven's toolchains support.
Log4j 2 provides sample toolchains XML files in the root folder. This may be used by
modifying it and installing the file as toolchains.xml in the .m2 folder or by using the 
following when invoking Maven.

macOS:: `-t ./toolchains-sample-mac.xml`
Windows:: `-t ./toolchains-sample-win.xml`
GNU/Linux:: `-t ./toolchains-sample-linux.xml`

To build and install Log4j in your local Maven cache, from the parent project directory, and
using Java 7 or 8, run: `mvn install`

Note that if your `/etc/hosts` file does not include an entry for your computer's hostname, then
many unit tests may execute slowly due to DNS lookups to translate your hostname to an IP address in
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/InetAddress.html#getLocalHost()[`InetAddress::getLocalHost`].
To remedy this, you can execute the following:

[source,bash]
----
printf '127.0.0.1 %s\n::1 %s\n' `hostname` `hostname` | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
----

Then to build the full site, you must use a local staging directory:

[source,bash]
----
mvn site
# then if Windows:
mvn site:stage-deploy -DstagingSiteURL=file:///%HOME%/log4j
# else if Unix:
mvn site:stage-deploy -DstagingSiteURL=file:///$HOME/log4j
----

To rebuild only what's changed and execute the tests, run: `mvn test`

To rebuild from scratch, add "clean"; for example: `mvn clean test`
